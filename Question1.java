//                  Explanation of This Program

// 1. First, we import some built-in Java classes:
//    - FileReader: This is used to open and read the file.
//    - BufferedReader: This helps us read the file line by line easily.

// 2. Then we create a FileReader object like this:
//    FileReader fileReader = new FileReader("data.txt");
//    This line basically tells Java to open the file named "data.txt".

// 3. Now we wrap that FileReader inside a BufferedReader:
//    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);
//    This makes it easier to read one full line from the file at a time.

// 4. To read a line from the file, we write:
//    String line = reader.readLine();
//    This line reads the first line of text from the file and saves it into a variable called "line".

// 5. If the file has data separated by TABs (like This    Is    Sabeer), we can split it like this:
//    String[] words = line.split("\t");
//    Now each word (or field) is saved separately in an array called "words".

// 6. We can use a while loop to go through each word and do something with it:
//    For example, printing each word in capital letters using System.out.println().

// 7. Finally, we must close the file using:
//    reader.close();
//    This is very important. It closes the file and frees up memory so the file doesnâ€™t stay open.
