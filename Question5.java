//   Explanation

// 1. Import required classes:
//    - FileReader: to open the file.
//    - BufferedReader: to read text line by line easily.
//    - IOException: to handle input/output errors.

// 2. Start with BufferedReader variable "reader" set to null,
//    meaning the file is not opened yet.

// 3. Use try-catch-finally to safely open, read, and close the file:

//    Inside try block:
//    - Try to open the file using FileReader.
//    - Wrap FileReader with BufferedReader for easy reading.
//    - Read one line (optional) and print it to show file opened.

//    Inside catch block:
//    - If an error happens (like file missing), print "File could not be opened."

//    Inside finally block (this runs no matter what):
//    - Check if "reader" is not null (file opened successfully).
//      If yes, try to close the file and print "File closed successfully."
//    - If "reader" is still null (file never opened), print "File was not opened."
//    - Also handle any errors during file closing.
